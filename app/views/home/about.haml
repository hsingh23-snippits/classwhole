    %p
      Classwhole was developed by 
      %a{:href=>"http://kryali.com"} Kiran Ryali,
      %a{:href=>"http://jhuze.com"} Jon Hughes,
      and
      %a{:href=>"http://swilso.com"} Scott Wilson
      for <a href="http://illinois.edu">UIUC</a>.

    %p We built Classwhole because we wanted a better way to discover classes and the people in them. 

    %p Currently, we're compiling feedback and making improvements for our second launch in April 2012.

    %p So if you have any suggestions, please send them to <span class="to-reverse email">moc.elohwssalc@kcabdeef</span>
