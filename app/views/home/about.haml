    %p
      Classwhole was developed by 
      %a{:href=>"http://kryali.com"} Kiran Ryali,
      %a{:href=>"http://jhuze.com"} Jon Hughes,
      and
      %a{:href=>"http://swilso.com"} Scott Wilson
      for <a href="http://illinois.edu">UIUC</a>.

    %p 
      We built Classwhole because we wanted a better way to discover classes and the people in them. 
    %p 
      Currently, we're compiling feedback and making improvements. So if you have any suggestions, please send them to <span reverse-text "email">moc.elohwssalc@kcabdeef</span>
